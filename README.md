Backstory: What is goodness? In my opinion, goodness is just a set of actions, no matter how big or small, that are taken to create a better world.
A better world is one without needless suffering, brutality, oppresssion, etc. Sadly, people don't choose goodness because they feel like they can't afford it. The Road is a perfect example; survival of the fittest leads to a lack of kindness (inspired section 1 of this game).
In Godot (section 2), the despair caused by this feeling of hopelessness leads to paralysis. My biggest takeway from this class is that only by taking action can we realize that we can afford a lot more goodness than we think.
Once we realize that we can be bigger forces for good than we think, we can reach "enlightenment"/"nirvana" as Siddhartha puts it (section 3). I prefer to call it a "self-actualization"; frequently, a sense of purpose comes from contributing to something greater than ourselves. When we stop hoarding all "good" things to ouselves, then we can truly make the best investment of all for a better world. Not money, not even time, but goodness!

In this game, the more "magic gems" you give away, the slower you become, which does make the game more inconvenient to play. You do have choices to reduce this inconvenience(they're a surprise!). As you progress, though, you'll find that making the journey is worth it when you save the lives of two helpless NPCs.

I tried my best to explore this theme of goodness in a short game...hopefully you notice these themes and NOT any glitchesðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
Anyways, go play!
